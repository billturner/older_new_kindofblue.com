I've done it again. I've wiped the previous weblog away and have started over again. However, this time I'm not even bothering with keeping the older posts around. It's all gone.

With the mind-boggling changes coming to the country in a couple of months, I'm hoping to get this up and going to have it as something to focus my energy on. If this ends up being a creative distraction, then all the better.

I've switched back to using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to build the weblog, if only because it makes managing my server a bit easier (no constant upgrades to WordPress and MySQL).

Let's see if that means things will be updated more often around here.
