A while back I came across the ["now page"](http://nownownow.com/about "About the now page") idea that [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/ "Derek Sivers' homepage") started. While it's not a totally unique idea, it is a nice exercise on keeping a public "to do" or "doing" list.

I've [added one here](//kindofblue.com/now.html "My now page here on kindofblue.com") and I'm going to do my best to keep it updated. It doesn't feel like I have a whole lot going on at the moment, but seeing everything there in one place does serve as a nice reminder of the tasks I've told myself I should be working on.

I'll try and keep that page up to date, but also use it as a reminder of things to make myself busy with when I find myself thinking "I'm bored."
