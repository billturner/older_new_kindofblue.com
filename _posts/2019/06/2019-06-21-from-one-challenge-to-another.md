Well, I didn't complete the Every Day in May challenge [like I was hoping to]({{site.url}}/2019/05/giving-every-day-in-may-another-try/), but I _did_ do better than last year. Last year I completed 10 of the daily challenges; this year, [I finished 17](https://www.flickr.com/photos/billturner/albums/72157678000500867 'The Flickr album of my sketches from this year'). But even without completing all of the prompts, I am pretty happy with a few of the sketches:

- [a bunch of bananas](https://www.flickr.com/photos/billturner/46876723815/in/album-72157678000500867/ 'Flickr page of my sketch of bananas')
- [the Greentree water tower](https://www.flickr.com/photos/billturner/47840064532/in/album-72157678000500867/ 'Flickr page of my sketch of the Greentree water tower')
- [a couple of books](https://www.flickr.com/photos/billturner/47840064532/in/album-72157678000500867/ 'Flickr page of my sketch of a couple of books') - extra special because I used my little paint kit, which had been lost for months
- [my late grandfather's tractor](https://www.flickr.com/photos/billturner/46852488795/in/album-72157678000500867/ 'Flickr page of my sketch of a tractor')

So, what's this other challenge then? This go around it's not a sketching challenge, but a programming one instead: [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/ 'The RoguelikeDev subreddit') Does [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/ 'A link to the Roguelike tutorial that we will be following'). Basically, we'll follow along with a multi-step tutorial - completing a little bit each week - and by the end, we should have a somewhat full-featured, text-based game. Since the tutorial uses the Python language, that's [another bonus]({{site.url}}/2019/02/learning-python/ 'A link to my earlier post on this site about learning Python.') the challenge has.

I had never played many [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike 'Link to Wikipedia page on roguelikes') games in the past, but more recently they have caught my interest. Since I've lost most of any skill I had in the past for first-person shooter games (which I played _a lot_ of in the 90s and early 00s), I've become more interested in other kinds of video games. One example, is [Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves 'Link to the Dwarf Fortress home page'). While it's not technically a roguelike - though it looks a lot like one - I've been diving into the madness that is that game. I'm sure I'll have a post on that game at some point, too.
