![A wonderful comic by Alex Norris on learning distractions]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2019/03/oh-no-comic.jpg 'A wonderful comic by Alex Norris on learning distractions')

With the internet, there are so many resources available to help you learn about something new - a new recipe, a new hotel, a new celebrity couple, and a new-to-you programming language. In fact, there are often _too many_ resources and opinions out there, and finding the right place to start learning can be quite daunting. I've found this to be the case lately while [trying to learn Python]({{site.url}}/2019/02/learning-python/ 'Previous post on my quest to learn Python').

In addition to the book and tutorial I mentioned last post, I've also been going through [another tutorial](http://rogueliketutorials.com/libtcod/1 'Part 1 of the roguelike tutorial I am working through') on how to write a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike 'Wikipedia article on roguelike games') game using Python. Despite the varied resources, I feel like I'm beginning to get a better grip on the language and its syntax.

But then I wanted to start working on an initial [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/ 'Flask documentation') API for [Lists of Bests]({{site.url}}/tag/lists-of-bests/ 'Lists of Bests posts here on the blog'). Sounds somewhat simple enough, but once I started looking at documentation and tutorials, I quickly became overwhelmed. Flask by itself could probably do what I want, but I found references to all kinds of libraries to supposedly make things easier. There's [RESTful](https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 'Flask-RESTful documentation'), and then [RESTPlus](https://flask-restplus.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ 'Flask-RESTPlus documentation'), and another with the awesome name [Marshmallow](https://flask-marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ 'Flask-Marshmallow documentation'). And I'm sure that's not all of them.

I think I may need to take another approach at this. Since I'm still quite new to the language, I think I'll start with the most simple example first - without any extra libraries or distractions. I think if I can get my head around the basics, it will be much easier to add in those libraries later. And I may not even need them. I'll attempt to document my learning into a couple of blog posts in the chance that someone else happens to have fallen into the library well like I did.
