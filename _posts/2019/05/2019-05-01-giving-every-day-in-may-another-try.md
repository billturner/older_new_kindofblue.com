![Every Day in May 2019, first day entry]({{site.url}}/assets/images/2019/05/edim.png 'Every Day in May 2019, first day entry')

If you look at [my Flickr album for 2018's Every Day in May](https://www.flickr.com/photos/billturner/albums/72157694590773441 'My Every Day in May entries for 2018'), you'll see I was only able to complete 10 of the 31 challenges. I can't recall what led me to stop keeping up with the entries, but I plan to give it a better attempt this year.

I'll admit that some of [this year's prompts](https://www.facebook.com/groups/edmeverydayinmay/permalink/2252555548157156/) are a little different - like "Your favorite song" - but overall I think they're all doable. And there are a few I am looking forward to, like "a ruined building," and "a toy." I should be able to have fun with those and most of the others on the list.

As I complete each challenge, I'll post the result to [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/billturner/albums/72157678000500867 'Flickr Album for Every Day in May 2019') and [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/billturner/ 'My Instagram page'). Now, if only I could find my watercolor set.
