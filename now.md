A list of items I'm currently doing my best to focus my attention on. This is based on the ["now page"](http://nownownow.com/about "About the now page") idea by [Derek Sivers](https://sivers.org/ "Derek Sivers' website").

* Lists of Bests

> [As explained in a post here on the site](/2017/10/bringing-back-an-old-friend "Blog post explaining about bringing back Lists of Bests"), I'm going to try and bring back an old project of mine. I don't plan on bringing it back to its former glory, but I'd like to get it pretty close.

* [Sketching Prompt Randomizer](http://prompts.kindofblue.com/)

> A simple creative prompt generator I wrote mainly as an exercise to teach myself [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/ "React homepage") and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/ "Redux documentation site"). It doesn't do a whole lot now, but my plan is to expand it to allow you to specify your own subjects and techniques. Note: it looks a bit better viewing on a phone instead of a desktop.

* Beginner Javascript introduction

> I've started writing a simple, beginner Javascript introductory "class" to explain the basics and teach some simple programming concepts. I only have a couple of lessons halfway written so far, but I really want to get started working on it again.

* [The Tools Artists Use](http://thetoolsartistsuse.com/ "The Tools Artists Use homepage")

> This has been on hiatus for almost three years now, but I'm going to start making progress on getting it running again. I don't think I'll stick with the same long-form interview format, but I'll start updating it with something! Unfortunately, there are many technical hurdles to jump to get it functioning properly, like a weblog software update, moving a lot of image files around, and other boring tasks.

* Sketching, and more sketching

> Over the last few years, I've really made a point to put something down in a sketchbook as often as I can. You can keep up with my progress on [Flickr](https://flickr.com/billturner "My Flickr page"), [Instagram](https://instagram.com/billturner "My Instagram page"), and the [#sketching tag](//kindofblue.com/tag/sketching/) here.

* This weblog

> I started this up again with the goal of updating more, but that hasn't really happened yet. I'm hoping a fresh burst of motivation in the new year will get me moving.
