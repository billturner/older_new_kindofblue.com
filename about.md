I am a father, a husband, a developer, and a Texan living in Pittsburgh, PA. I'm currently employed as a lead front-end engineer by the nice folks at [CloudPassage](http://cloudpassage.com/). We're doing some really neat stuff with cloud server security.

#### About the name

The name, Kind of Blue, comes from the [Miles Davis jazz album](http://amzn.to/2fBqDIU "Buy this wonderful album, via Amazon.com") of the same name. Other than being named after the album, there is no specific meaning.
